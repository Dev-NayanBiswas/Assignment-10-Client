##### *Errors and Challenges*
- *As criteria I took challenge to apply react-hook-form for all input fields except search bar. Here I learn few new functionalities like how to handle error, crating setError manually, register input fields and handling errors with formState:{errors}, clear manual Errors, reset input fields, watch specific field changes like state, control and Controller concepts are not really clear yet...*
- *React-simple-Rating was not so simple to handle with react hook form*
- *As add and Edit are the quite similar functionality same form for both Add and Edit operations based on conditions and mode*
- *Tried to apply add to favorite button toggler which one through me into an infinity loop*
- *Search functionality was awesome thanks to Shariyar Vai for better explanation, few things are clear but still now need to learn more about MongoDB and Node.js*
- *Thanks to Dave Gray, procademy, piyushGarg, codeWithRobby for a global error handler, cause it was really great and effective way to handle error rather then watching red texts on terminals.Know this was not an standard way to handle it I just tried to apply just a portion of their huge project, still learning and getting confused but improving myself*
- *Tried to apply framer motion animation here though I'am in learning process but I found it quite easier then GSAP animation*
- *Tried to explain my whole project into mermaid charts I found it really great to explain and to debug codes*
